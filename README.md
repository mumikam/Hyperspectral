# Hyperspectral Image Sparse Coding and Tensor Decomposition

This GitHub repository contains the implementation of a novel technique for hyperspectral image (HSI) processing, which combines sparse coding and tensor decomposition to efficiently handle high-dimensional HSI data. The proposed approach significantly improves computational efficiency, classification performance, and data compression in hyperspectral imaging.

## Environment

The work in this repository was primarily conducted using Google Colab, a cloud-based Python environment that offers convenient access to GPUs and TPUs for accelerated computations. You can easily replicate our experiments by running the provided notebooks in a Google Colab environment. Additionally, Python 3.11.2 was used as the coding language for acquiring desired solutions.

## Datasets

We used several hyperspectral datasets for our experiments:

- **Indian Pines Dataset:** A hyperspectral image collected by the 220-band AVIRIS sensor over single landscape in Indiana, US.

- **Pavia University Dataset:** A hyperspectral image dataset gathered by a sensor known as the reflective optics system imaging spectrometer (ROSIS-3) over the city of Pavia, Italy.

- **Salinas Scene Dataset:** A hyperspectral image collected by the 224-band AVIRIS sensor over Salinas Valley, California, characterized by high spatial resolution (3.7-meter pixels).

- **Botswana Dataset:** A hyperspectral classification dataset acquired by the NASA EO-1 satellite over the Okavango Delta, Botswana, in 2001-2004.
